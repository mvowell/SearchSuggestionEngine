Classes:
	MainGUI
		Transfers the current search string to the SearchProcessor
		Receives new search strings from the SearchProcessor following the rules established by the requirements
		Methods:
			MainGUI(SearchProcessor) - constructor with processor passed to it
			String[] sendSearchString(String) - gets suggested search queries from the SearchProcessor
			void updateResults() - update the gui to the new list of words
			void searchQuery(String) - passes search string to Google 
	SearchProcessor
		Communicates strings to the dictionary to check words
		Receives lists of strings as words that are corrections,extensions, or following words
		Methods:
			SearchProcessor(Dictionary) - constructor, dictionary passsed
			String[] receiveSearchString(String) - called by MainGUI to get the suggested results
	Dictionary
		Gives words to the dictionary data class to check if those words exist
		Receives dictionary words from the DictionaryData class or boolean checks to check if a word exists
		Methods:
			Dictionary(DictionaryData,KeyDistance)
			boolean isWord(String) - checks if a word is a word
			String[] correctWord(String) - corrects a word by replacing letters
				internal String[] getSwapped(String) - check for letter swaps
				internal String[] getDistanceErrors(String) - checks letter distances to see if there was a typo

			String[] followWord(String) - checks for words which would commonly follow the given word
	DictionaryData
		Contains list of words and following words
		Returns true/false if contains word and following words for a given word
		Methods:
